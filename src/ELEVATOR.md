# Main Tasks

In the following chapters, you will find detailed documentation of the systemâ€™s design and functionality. 
Each task is represented by its own State Diagram, showing the sequence of operations and state transitions. 

You will then find a Sequence Diagram that shows the communication between the two tasks, demonstrating how they interact and exchange information. 
Finally, a Sequence Diagram will depict how a function is called by one of the tasks, highlighting the modular design of the program.
