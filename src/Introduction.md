# PROJECT INTRODUCITON

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program using Structured Text (ST) programming. 
The program will simulate a chosen process, translating a real-life routine into code. 

The development process will be managed through version control in GIT, ensuring collaborative and organized tracking of changes.
In addition to the PLC code, the project will include comprehensive documentation with the following diagrams:

-State diagrams for each task, illustrating the various operational states and transitions.

-Sequence diagrams to depict the communication and interaction between the two tasks.

-A Sequence diagram illustrating the invocation of the function by the task.
